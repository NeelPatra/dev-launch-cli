A zero-dependency Windows batch utility that streamlines your development workflow. Instantly launch specific localhost ports in a stripped-down **App Mode** browser environment with DevTools auto-opened.

## ⚡ Why use this?

When developing web apps, you don't need address bars, bookmarks, or tabs cluttering your view. You need the UI and the Code.

- **Standard Browser:** Heavy, distracted, requires manual DevTools opening (F12).
- **DevLaunch CLI:** One keystroke to open a clean, floating debug window with Inspector ready.

## ✨ Features

-  **Distraction Free:** Uses Chromium's `--app` flag to remove browser UI.
- ️ **Incognito Ready:** Native support for Private/Incognito sessions for auth testing.
- ⚡ **Keyboard Driven:** Instant navigation using `CHOICE` (no Enter key needed).
-  **Smart Paste:** One-key option to launch the URL currently in your clipboard.
- ⚙️ **Configurable:** Edit the top of the script to set your own preferred ports.

##  Installation

1. Download `dev-launch.bat`.
2. Place it in a folder included in your **System PATH** (optional, for global access).
3. Run it!
